                  <p class="edu">SUNSHINE gaps in education systems with innovative, low-cost, replicable interventions that span the age spectrum. Working both directly and through government systems, these programs collectively reach millions of children and thousands of school dropouts each year. In “direct” work, a SUNSHINE instructor works with children either in the school or in the community, whereas the “partnership” model involves SUNSHINE teams working closely with government teams at the state, district or city level to design and implement programs. SUNSHINE’s approach to improving learning outcomes continues to serve as a model, both within India and beyond.</p>

              <p class="edu">Over 85% of a child’s cumulative brain development occurs prior to the age of 6 years.  Providing appropriate care and nurturing to children in their early and formative years is therefore critical for ensuring optimal growth and development. India’s New Education Policy (NEP 2020) underscores this crucial importance of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN). In this evolving landscape, SUNSHINE continues to invest heavily in expanding and exploring how to impact children’s holistic development and foundational abilities during these early years. SUNSHINE believes that building strong foundational abilities in children during their early years will make them effective learners and eliminate the need for remedial interventions in the later years.

              <p class="edu">More than 95% of 6-14 year-old children in India are enrolled in schools. However, ASER and other surveys show that a significant proportion of these children complete primary schooling without acquiring foundational reading and arithmetic skills, and therefore, are unable to cope with subsequent curricular expectations. One of SUNSHINE’s key goals is to enable such children acquire basic reading and arithmetic skills, quickly and sustainably, so that they can meaningfully benefit from further education opportunities.</p>

              <p class="edu">SUNSHINE’s experience indicates that once a learner has dropped out of school, it is near impossible for them to find their way back. While India has open schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to continue their education.

The centre promotes a culture of evidence-based decision making and seeks to develop and use simple yet rigorous methods to generate evidence on scale on the outcomes of social sector programs, especially education. It also aims to strengthen the link between evidence and action by building the capacity of individuals and institutions to design, conduct, understand and communicate the results of assessments that focus on key outcome indicators.</p>

        </div>
            <div class="container">
            <p class="EW1">Over the past decade, gender equality has been recognized as crucial not only to the health of nations but also to their social and economic development. The promotion of gender equality and women empowerment is a key aspect of UNDPâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals. It involves promoting equal rights, opportunities, and access to resources for women, enabling them to make independent choices and have control over their lives. Empowered women contribute to economic growth, social progress, and sustainable development. They play active roles in decision-making processes, education, healthcare, and leadership positions. Women empowerment fosters a more balanced and diverse society, where women's voices are heard, their talents are recognized, and their potential is fully realized. It is a vital step towards building a more equitable and harmonious world for all.</p>

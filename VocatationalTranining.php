            SUNSHINE launched its Vocational Skilling program in 2005. The objective was to train youth (18‐25 years) from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and provide them with employable skills, coupled with access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Today, SUNSHINE’s Skilling programs are spread across the country to enable youth to access entry-level jobs in 10 major vocations. SUNSHINE’s affiliations include the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and multiple Sector Skill Councils. In 2020, SUNSHINE re-designed its training models to incorporate digital resources and launched the Hybrid Skilling program, with the primary focus of helping youth find employment in the post-pandemic world.
